 * Provides access to a TAP virtual Ethernet device driver.

 * This facility relies on the @ref event-loop implementation in %AIpStack.
 * 
 * The following platforms are currently supported:
 * - Linux: Uses the TUN/TAP driver that comes with the kernel.
 * - Windows: Uses the TAP-Windows driver.
 * 
 * After a @ref TapDevice object is constructed, frames received from the driver
 * will be reported via the @ref FrameReceivedHandler callback function and
 * frames can be sent to the driver using @ref sendFrame.
 * 
 * Note that there is no actual "TapDevice" class, but only a type alias for a
 * class which provides the interface described here for a specific platform
 * (e.g. TapDeviceLinux or TapDeviceWindows).
