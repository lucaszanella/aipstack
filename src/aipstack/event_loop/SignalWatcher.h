/**
 * Enables reception of operating-system signals in the event loop using @ref
 * SignalWatcher.
 * 
 * Signals can be received by first constructing an instance of @ref SignalCollector and
 * then constructing a @ref SignalWatcher referencing the former.
 * 
 * The actual function of @ref SignalCollector is platform-dependent. Currently this is:
 * - On Linux, it blocks the specified signals on construction and unblocks them on
 *   destruction (only if they were not originally blocked). Actual reception of signals
 *   would be done via `signalfd` by @ref SignalWatcher.
 * - On Windows, it sets up a handler using `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` on construction and
 *   removes the handler on destruction. It additionally manages a queue of received
 *   signals for delivery via @ref SignalWatcher.
 * 
 * The level of support for concurrent instances of @ref SignalCollector depends on the
 * platform:
 * - On Linux, concurrent instances are allowed if there is no overlap in the signals
 *   collected by different @ref SignalCollector instances. If this is violated there
 *   should not be any exceptions but it will not work properly for signals collected by
 *   more than one instance.
 * - On Windows, concurrent instances are not allowed at all. Attempting to construct a
 *   @ref SignalWatcher while one already exists will result in an exception.
